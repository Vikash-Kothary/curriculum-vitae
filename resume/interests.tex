In addition to my education and work, I have a lot of interest in various other things with my health being one of them. I enjoy regularly visiting my local gym after breakfast combining strength training and high-intensity cardio which helps me stay energised throughout the day. During the workout, I listen to popular non-fiction audiobooks or podcasts to advance my knowledge. I have also been learning to cook various cuisines of food since this is another key interest of mine. I am even making my way through a beginners’ cookbook, aiming to make a new dish every week or two to awaken my taste buds. To wind down, I love TV shows or movies of various genres whether it’s action, comedy, romance, sci-fi and/fantasy I appreciate them all, enjoying them on the PC that I built myself.
